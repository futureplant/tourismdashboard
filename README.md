The dashboard goes together with a report. The report can be requested through e-mail (joey.hodde@wur.nl)

It describes patterns of tourism in the city of Amsterdam and shows what the (dis)similarities between neighbourhoods are. This is based on hotelbed and AirbnB bed densities, the infiltration of AirBnBs, social media geotagged messages and a clustering analysis.
It supplied together with all the data that is needed to run the app.R script.
Run the app.R script to take a look at the dashboard itself. In there you can find additional information about the visualization.

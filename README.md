# tourismdashboard
The dashboard goes together with a report. The report can be requested through e-mail (joey.hodde@wur.nl)

It describes patterns of tourism in the city of Amsterdam and shows what the (dis)similarities between neighbourhoods are. This is based on hotelbed and AirbnB bed densities, the infiltration of AirBnBs, social media geotagged messages and a clustering analysis.
It supplied together with all the data that is needed to run the app.R script.
Run the app.R script to take a look at the dashboard itself. In there you can find additional information about the visualization.

It is important to keep the names app.R and ui.R like they are. Otherwise it is not possible to run the scripts. This is also the reason that they do not have the same numbering fashion as the other scripts.
